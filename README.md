# Blackbook: A Membership System for Elixir

[![Hex.pm Version](http://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/timex_ecto.svg?style=flat)](https://hex.pm/packages/stripity_stripe)

The concept here is pretty simple: *a membership system that goes beyond registration and authentication*. User management is a Big Deal, and I dislike the Quick and Dirty systems out there so I made my own.

Rolling your own auth is a cliche yes but the auth systems out there that I've used don't quite do what I want. And what do I want? *I just want to know what happened, when*. Beyond `registration` and `authentication` - I want logs, notes, communication and all kinds of lock-downs, status changes and service-based logins that make sense.

Nothing that requires a degree in astro-botany, just sane data handling in a transactional sense. So that's what this is.

## Work In Progress

I'm still building this. So... yeah.

## TODO

 - Status changers
 - Communications basics
 - Email verification hooks
 - Role functions
